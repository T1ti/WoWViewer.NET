# WTEditor rendering feature status

This file is the maintained implementation ledger for the active Avalonia/DX11
editor. Update it whenever a rendering feature changes status. “Implemented”
means the feature is connected to live editor rendering and covered by the
repository smoke suite; it does not imply parity with every WoW client era.

## World environment

| Feature | Status | Current scope / remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ADT terrain geometry and textures | Implemented | Layered diffuse/height textures, LOD, editor overlays, culling, and streaming are active. |
| WMO rendering | Implemented | Groups, materials, instancing, doodad sets, portal visibility, and selection are active. |
| M2 rendering | Implemented | Static geometry/material combinations and instancing are active. Skeletal animation, particles, ribbons, and animated texture transforms are not yet implemented. |
| MH2O liquid rendering | Implemented | Geometry, material families, LightData colors, and LightParams alpha are active. All-zero named LightData color quartets resolve to the shared non-black client-material palette in both renderer and UI snapshots while retaining the selected LightParams alpha values. Advanced client liquid shaders remain partial. |
| Dynamic time-of-day lighting | Implemented | Light/LightData/LightParams are loaded by DBD column name and evaluated on the circular 0–2880 timeline. Map navigation is durable view-model state, replayed whenever the DX11 renderer attaches/restarts, then retained by the engine until content/database initialization finishes and applied on the render thread with dynamic evaluation enabled. Renderer-owned controls are read-only while live lighting is active, and delayed TwoWay control echoes cannot disable dynamic updates. |
| Local radial lights | Implemented | Light falloff volumes are blended from the camera in renderer-native center-origin GameCoords space. |
| Zone lighting | Implemented | ZoneLight polygons use the same center-origin camera space, including vertical bounds, transition distance, and priority ordering. |
| LightData sky colors | Implemented | Top, middle, band 1/2, smog, and fog colors drive a camera-oriented gradient sky pass. |
| LightParams skybox model override | Implemented | LightSkybox is resolved by named columns and its SkyboxFileDataID is rendered as a camera-centred static M2. Flag 0x4 flattens the cone to the available sky-fog color. |
| Multiple skybox crossfades | Implemented | Distinct default, zone, and local skyboxes are retained together, their opacity weights are interpolated through each spatial blend, and every active model is submitted. |
| Animated skybox models | Not yet | M2 animation playback and the LightSkybox time-animation flag are not implemented. |
| Celestial skybox override | Not yet | CelestialSkyboxFileDataID is decoded but not submitted. |
| Sun, moons, and stars | Not yet | Directional exterior lighting is active, but celestial discs and star fields are not rendered. |
| Cloud layers | Not yet | LightData cloud colors/density and cloud textures are not rendered. |
| Distance/height/sun fog | Not yet | The current passes do not consume the full LightData fog parameter set, so skybox flag 0x4 uses SkyFogColor rather than EndFogColor. |
| Color grading | Not yet | LightData color-grading FileDataIDs are not applied. |

## Rendering infrastructure

| Feature | Status | Current scope / remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DX11 frame presentation | Implemented | Keyed-mutex presentation and resize-safe render targets are active. |
| Hierarchical frustum/distance culling | Implemented | Terrain, WMO, M2, and liquid passes expose workload telemetry. |
| Sky-pass telemetry | Implemented | Sky draw calls, submitted indices, and CPU submission time are tracked by SceneManager. |
| Shadows | Not yet | No terrain/model shadow-map pass is present. |
| Reflections | Not yet | No planar, cubemap, or screen-space reflection pass is present. |
| Post-processing | Not yet | Bloom, exposure, tone mapping, anti-aliasing, and client color grading are not present. |
